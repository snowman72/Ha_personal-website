            <h1>My Skills</h1>
            <h3>Programming experience with Python, Pascal</h3>
            <p>I studied Pascal as a compulsory school subject when I was in grade 8 or 9, and in high school. At the time I didn't think much about it. It was only when I entered university that I find myself enjoy programming and wanting to pursue it as a career.</p>
            <h3>CSS battle</h3>
            <p>Recently I just discovered a site called CSS Battle- where I can build a wide range of figures from HTML and CSS only. Up to now, I have solved more than 20 problems, and I gained great enthusiasm from it. However, now I need to finish my assignments first üòÑ.</p>
